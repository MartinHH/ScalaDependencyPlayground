# ScalaDependencyPlayground

This repository serves as a playground for tests and experiments related to the
analysis of project dependencies, mainly via
[sbt-dependency-submission](https://github.com/scalacenter/sbt-dependency-submission).

Currently, it is only used to observe which dependencies are already being
introduced to the
[dependency graph](https://github.com/MartinHH/ScalaDependencyPlayground/network/dependencies)
by a totally empty sbnt projects (that only depends on scala itself).
